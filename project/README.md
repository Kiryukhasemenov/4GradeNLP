## This is project of group 2:
Кирилл Семенов, Александра Смирнова, Торубаров Иван, Мамонова Татьяна

### UPD:
The programming files are in two `.ipynb` notebooks. We run them on Google Colab, so they can also be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qFUaNfOx2QAF2GLClICN_KR6pxr3IKoq/view?usp=sharing and here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L_Gn4k-pYamUgm6eWJfsD9g58yVPJGdc

The resulting lexicon is in `lexicon.txt` file. 

The mini-report on out programming part is in `Группа №2 - мини_отчет.docx` file.

Finally, our files require many auxiliary files. They all can be found in my dropbox. All paths to them are in notebooks, but they can also be found in `dropbox_files.txt` file.

The report is in "Группа №2" file
